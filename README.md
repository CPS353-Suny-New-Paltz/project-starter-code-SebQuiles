# Software Engineering Project Starter Code

This repo will start you off with an initial configuration that you'll modify as part of Checkpoint 1. As part of the modifications, you'll eventually delete the contents of this README and replace it with documentation for your project.

The system will convert the input integer into English words and proper formatting. For example the input "21" would result in an output of "twenty-one". 

Example

**Using '=' as the key-value seperator:**  
Input: 21  
Output: '21=twenty-one'

**Using ';' as the pair separator and the '=' as the key-value separator:**  
Input: 6;12;21  
Output: '6=six;12=twelve;21=tweny-one'
